## 2026-02-07 - CLI Onboarding UX
**Learning:** UX isn't just for GUIs. Adding an `--init` flag to generate a starter configuration file significantly reduces onboarding friction for CLI tools, acting as a "helpful empty state."
**Action:** For CLI tools with complex configuration, always look for ways to scaffold the initial setup (e.g., `init` commands, interactive wizards).

## 2026-02-08 - CLI Feedback Loops
**Learning:** CLI output is a UI. Improving table formatting (removing redundancy, better alignment) and providing immediate "next steps" feedback (e.g., after `init`) drastically improves the "feel" of a CLI tool.
**Action:** When designing CLI output, always ask: "What does the user need to know next?" and "Is this information redundant?".
