## 2026-01-27 - Benchmarking Allocation Optimizations
**Learning:** When benchmarking optimizations that avoid allocations (like using `[]byte` instead of `string`), ensure the benchmark includes the cost of the allocation being removed. Benchmarking only the processing function might show a regression if the allocation happened in the caller.
**Action:** Always benchmark the full path or simulate the inputs realistically (e.g. including conversions) to prove the benefit of reducing allocations.

## 2026-01-27 - Regexp Allocation Limits
**Learning:** Go's `regexp.FindSubmatchIndex` still allocates the `[]int` result slice. While it reduces memory usage compared to `FindSubmatch` (which allocates `[][]byte`), it doesn't eliminate allocations entirely. Zero-alloc regex capturing requires different libraries or manual parsing.
**Action:** For hot paths requiring zero allocations, prefer manual parsing (`bytes.Index`, etc.) over `regexp` if feasible, otherwise accept the reduced but non-zero allocation of `FindSubmatchIndex`.

## 2026-03-04 - Reusing bufio.Scanner buffer across stream reconnects
**Learning:** Allocating a large buffer (1MB) inside a reconnect loop creates unnecessary heap pressure, even if the reconnects are not extremely frequent. Go's bufio.Scanner can reuse an existing byte slice via scanner.Buffer().
**Action:** Hoist the scanner buffer allocation outside of reconnect loops to reuse the memory and significantly reduce allocations (from 1MB/alloc down to 0).
