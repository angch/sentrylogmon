## 2026-02-02 - [Smart List Truncation]
**Learning:** When truncating a list of items for a compact table view, blind character counting can hide all data if the first item is long or if the suffix " (+N more)" pushes the first item over the limit. A better UX guarantees at least the first item is shown (truncated if necessary) before summarizing the rest.
**Action:** Use an item-aware truncation loop that prioritizes the first item's visibility and reserves space for the summary suffix only for subsequent items.
